# Application Overview

This application is a Proof of Concept (POC) for integrating Google login functionality with an external application. It serves as an intermediary that allows users to authenticate using their Google accounts and link them to existing accounts in an external system.

## Key Components

1. **Server Setup (`src/server.js`)**:
   - The application uses Node.js with the Express framework.
   - It sets up routes for handling authentication and general requests.
   - The server listens on a specified port (default is 3000) and uses EJS as the templating engine.

2. **Views**:
   - The application has several EJS templates for rendering HTML:
     - **`index.ejs`**: The main page with a button to initiate Google login.
     - **`google-login.ejs`**: A popup that handles Google authentication and linking accounts.
     - **`error.ejs`**: Displays error messages if something goes wrong.

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - When a user clicks the "Login with Google" button on the main page, a popup window opens to handle the Google login process.
   - The popup checks if the Google email is already linked to an external user account:
     - If linked, it generates a JWT token and sends it back to the parent application.
     - If not linked, it displays a form for the user to enter their external account details (username/password) and links the accounts via an API call.

4. **External API Integration**:
   - The application interacts with an external API to manage user accounts. The API endpoints are defined in `external-api.md` and include:
     - **Link Google Account**: Links a Google account to an external user account.
     - **Get External ID**: Retrieves the external ID associated with a Google email.
     - **Get JWT**: Obtains a JWT token for a user based on their Google email.

5. **Environment Configuration (`env.md`)**:
   - The application uses environment variables to configure various settings, including Google OAuth credentials and external API URLs.
   - It specifies routes for the external API and other necessary configurations.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**:
   - The user initiates the login process by clicking the "Login with Google" button on the main page.
   - A popup window opens, loading the Google login view.

2. **Google Authentication**:
   - The popup attempts to authenticate the user with Google.
   - If successful, it checks if the Google email is linked to an external account.

3. **Account Linking**:
   - If the account is already linked, the application generates a JWT token and sends it back to the parent window.
   - If not linked, the user is prompted to enter their external account details, which are then sent to the external API to link the accounts.

4. **Token Handling**:
   - The JWT token is received by the parent application, which can use it for authenticating the user in the external system.

## Conclusion

This application provides a seamless way to integrate Google authentication with an external user management system. It allows users to link their Google accounts with existing accounts in an external application, facilitating a smooth login experience. The use of JWT tokens ensures secure communication between the systems.
